Walter Almond, the events leading to Carters death began when Agee stopped a black 1997 Honda because of complaints that \"loud music\" coming from the vehicle was bothering some residents. A license check revealed the driver was wanted on a misdemeanor charge of property damage. When Agee returned to the vehicle, he asked the car's two passengers to step outside. When Carter emerged from the backseat, Almond said, four packets of marijuana fell from his clothing. Carter then bolted and led Agee on a circular foot chase. The ensuing pursuit ended with a tussle on Rosetta Street in which Agee tried to use pepper spray to subdue Carter. During the struggle, police say Carter got hold of Agee's revolver and shot him in the right arm, fracturing a bone. When Goldie and Goins arrived, they ordered Carter to drop the weapon. Instead, Almond says, Carter kept the gun trained on Agee. Goins and Goldie then fired numerous rounds, striking Carter from his leg to his left side.

Athena police Sgt. Erik Palmer shot and killed Tere David King, 55, of Athena on Pambrun Road just east of town. Primus said Palmer had spotted King’s vehicle and was going to arrest him for an eluding incident from Saturday. Palmer was waiting for backup when King drove toward him to leave the scene. Palmer then disabled King’s vehicle by shooting the tires, Primus said. After King’s vehicle was disabled, Palmer reported the suspect got out of his vehicle with a firearm, which is when the officer shot and killed him.","disposition":"Justified","source_url":"http://m.union-bulletin.com/news/2014/apr/29/update-investigation-continues-athena-mans-fatal-s/?templates=mobile","event":{"address":"Pambrun Road","date":"4/28/2014"}},"subject":{"age":"55","sex":"male","name":"Tere David King","race":" European-American/White","image_url":null,"mental_illness":"No"},"location":{"city":"Athena","county":"Umatilla","state":"OR","zipcode":"97813"},"submitted_by":"Ryan Williams","published":false}},{"id":"fatality_2537","key":"fatality_2537","value":{"death":{"cause":"automobile","cause_notes":"","responsible_agency":"Wind River Police Department","description":"There is almost no information online about this death except for an old yahoo group that copies an AP report.
